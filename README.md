### About the Experiment 

This experiment aims to simulate and analyze the behavior of a Band Reject Filter (BRF), also known as a Notch Filter, using an interactive web-based tool. A Band Reject Filter is designed to block (reject) a specific range of frequencies while allowing frequencies outside this range to pass through with minimal attenuation.

The simulation allows users to:

Set resistance (R) and capacitance (C) values.

Automatically calculate or manually input the center frequency (fâ‚€) where maximum rejection occurs.

Observe the frequency response (Gain vs Frequency) of the filter.

View the time-domain input and output waveforms using an oscilloscope-style chart.

Generate and listen to the filtered audio signal.
